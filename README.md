Data restructuring for significantly improved data I/O efficiencies within the ARD-Pipeline.

## Pre-commit setup

A [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) config is provided to automatically format
and check your code changes. This allows you to immediately catch and fix
issues before you raise a failing pull request (which run the same checks under
Travis).

If you don't use Conda, install pre-commit from pip:

    pip install pre-commit

If you do use Conda, install from conda-forge (*required* because the pip
version uses virtualenvs which are incompatible with Conda's environments)

    conda install pre_commit

Now install the pre-commit hook to the current repository:

    pre-commit install

Your code will now be formatted and validated before each commit. You can also
invoke it manually by running `pre-commit run`
